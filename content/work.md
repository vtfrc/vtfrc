I'm currently a software engineer at [Blue Reply](https://www.reply.com/blue-reply/it/), working on information processing systems in the financial sector.

I'm also an [advisor](mailto:vittorio@kleia.co) to innovative businesses, and I started a few projects, like [kleia](https://kleia.co), an innovation and technology hub and newsletter, and [Healti](https://healti.net), the modern personal health record.

On the technical side, some of the tools I use daily and love are Python, Java, PHP, Spring, Laravel, Vue, Flutter, Kafka, Hugo. A few domains I find intriguing are e-health, wellness, digital media, and intelligent transport.
