The usual annual reflection is here. For reference, [this] is last year's version(/2024).

What happened? Well, I graduated (yep, I'm an engineer now), I kept working, I didn't write as much as I wanted to.

That's the beauty of goals: there's always something missing, but that's always a way to use the past to try to plan the future.

The disillusion that was palpable in last year's reflection continues, but I can say I'm a bit more positive now. In the end, all we can control is our atomic actions, so the focus remains there in pretty much every area of life.

Work: work is good! My personal indicators indicate that I feel excited about the scope, the day-to-day, and the trajectory. There are always interesting things to discover and to build, so I'll keep doing that. We're lucky enough to live in an era where technology truly has uncapped potential, in the macro and in the micro.

Building and sharing still feel like the two most interesting things to do.

So, goals for 2025?

Probably very vague, but just growing in competence and impact, learning new things every day, writing more, exploring physically and metaphorically, giving, and enjoying.

Oh, the closing line has to be: here's to more life in 2025.
